# PublicReleases
Releases for those projects that I moved to a private git service 
(and also those I can't upload to here due to copyright issues, **PIRACY IS BAD! DO NOT DO IT!**)

**If you have encountered any issue with these softwares and wish to open an issue, please open it here instead of on my private git!**

Q: Why don't you upload to GitHub releases?
A: Repo will be taken down if I do that.

Here is the list:
